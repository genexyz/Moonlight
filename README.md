# MoonlightðŸš€

Moonlight's mission is to provide safe and reliable transportation of cargo across the Milky Way galaxy.

## Description

The idea behind this project is to allow users to securely and efficiently transport cargo and people across the Milky Way galaxy. The website features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily generate and view launches.

In addition to the core functionality of the website, I implemented several additional features to enhance the user experience and to learn more about the Tech Stack used. These included CRUD functionality for Rockets, Planets, Destinations within Planets, Launches and Users, as well as fully responsive design for optimal use on any device and a custom 404 page.

While these features are currently functional, there are still several additional functionalities that should be done to get the project closer to what a real implementation would be, as the current project focuses more on gaining a deeper understanding of the technologies used and to develop my skills in using them and as a software developer in general.

The website includes a demo user that can be used to test the various CRUD actions, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities. However, it is important to note that the demo user is only for testing purposes and any changes made during these actions will not be applied to the database. Instead, the website will simply notify the user that the change would have been correct or if it had any errors, without actually committing the change to the database.

One of the most unique features of the website is the use of AI-generated images to depict the various planets and destinations within the Milky Way galaxy. This added a visually appealing element to the website and enhanced the user experience.
Overall, working on this project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in full-stack web development and my ability to overcome technical challenges. It was also a great opportunity for me to learn more about implementing secure authentication and authorization protocols with battle-tested libraries, as well as the use of AI in web design.

## Tech Stack

For this project, I utilized a tech stack that included **NextJS** with **React** and **Node.js** on the front and back ends, respectively. I used **PostgreSQL** as the database, and **Prisma** as the ORM to facilitate the interaction between the application and the database.

To host the database, I utilized **Railway**, and for website hosting, I used **Vercel**.

For the user interface, I employed a combination of **React Bootstrap**, **MaterialUI**, **Framer Motion** and custom CSS inside **CSS modules**.

To ensure secure authentication, I implemented **NextAuth** with login through Github and Google.

For testing, I used **Cypress** integrated with **Github Actions** to test on each deploy.

To ensure high-quality code, I utilized **Sonarcloud** and **Lighthouse** for code analysis.

Overall, this tech stack allowed me to build a robust and scalable application that meets the needs of users and performs well under a variety of conditions. It was a great opportunity for me to learn and gain experience with a wide range of technologies and tools.

## Project Status

I will keep working on fixing any remaining bugs and adding additional functionalities to this project. I am also continuously looking for opportunities to improve the overall performance of the application and provide the best possible user experience.

My current TODO list about the next changes and fixes that i plan on doing to the website can be seen on the file [todo.txt](TODO.txt)
